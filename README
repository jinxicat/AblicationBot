Description:
This project is designed to automate the job application process.
In src/files/	there is a odt document called "input_cover_letter.odt".
This is where your cover letter text will be copied into.
Then, anywhere in the cover letter you mention the job title you are applying to
or the company you are applying to, you will need to replace them with [job title] and [company name] respectively.
The python script will replace [job title] and [company name] with what is found after scraping the hiring website.
